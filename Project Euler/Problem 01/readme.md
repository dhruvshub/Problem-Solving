## 1. Multiples of 3 or 5

This is a pretty straightforward problem. 
We need to find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 that 
are below 1000.

<br> We can solve it without programming by using Arithmetic Progression (AP).
<br>But to make our lives easier, we can use a very simple program running a loop from 0 to 1000 and checking if the number is divisible by 3 or 5, if yes then we add it to the sum, if not we proceed to the next number.
