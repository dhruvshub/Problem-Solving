Platform link: https://projecteuler.net/

I will use the filename as the problem name, the problem link would be commented out in the code itself.


The directory structure is going to be 
```
Project Euler
    |-Problem 1
        |- Problem Title.cpp
        |-readme.md (Containing the explanation/notes)
    |-Problem 2
        |- Problem Title.cpp
        |-readme.md (Containing the explanation/notes)    
```

### How to use this repository?

You've probably stumbled on this repository because you need help with a problem. 
So, instead of looking at the solution directly I would advice to go to that problem's readme and see the explanation.
And try to implement it in your own way.
