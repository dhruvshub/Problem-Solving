Platform link: https://projecteuler.net/

I will use the filename as the problem name, the problem link would be commented out in the code itself.


The directory structure is going to be 

Project Euler
    |-Problem 1
        |- Problem Title.cpp
        |-readme.md (Containing the explaination/notes)
    |-Problem 2
        |- Problem Title.cpp
        |-readme.md (Containing the explaination/notes)
