## 14. Longest Collatz Sequence

This problem is fairly simple, I am just following the rules mentioned in the 
problem and running a loop from 999999. In the loop I generate the sequence for
each term. Then I store the length of the sequence and the value of the term that generated the sequence.

After completing all iterations, I simply print the largest length and the corresponding number from the stored values.
